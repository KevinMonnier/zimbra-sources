To get the ZCS touch client running locally, follow the steps below.

1. Sync with Perforce. It should create the following directories:

	Project directory: .../main/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/t
	App directory: .../main/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/t/app
	SDK directory: .../main/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/t/touch

2. Download the open-source (GPL) current version of the Sencha Touch framework:

	http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download/

3. Copy the following files and directories from the download to the SDK directory:

	cmd/
	microloader/
	resources/
	sencha-touch-all-debug.js
	sencha-touch-all.js
	sencha-touch-debug.js
	sencha-touch.js
	src/
	version.txt

Basic login is present but it's pretty rough currently. You'll need to re-enter the URL
once or twice. The best URL for testing the touch client is:

	http://localhost:7070/t/login.jsp?client=mobile&breakpoint
